# Embargoed CVE Release

The main purpose of this release was to deliver embargoed security fixes that impacted all supported versions. Because these CVEs were under embargo, we couldn’t roll out the fixes one at a time—everything had to be released at once for every version. To handle this, we created the 2.19 catalogs with all the updated bundles included. Hence, the catalog for 2.22.2 was released as part of the 2.19.1 FBC.

We selected 2.19 because each RHOAI release supports only a certain range of OCP versions, and 2.19 was available on all of them. That made it the best fit to cover supported OCP range for all other RHOAI versions.
